<p class="small">The baccalaureate degree program in nursing (RN-to-BSN and ABSN) at Goodwin University is accredited by the <a href="http://www.ccneaccreditation.org">Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education</a> (CCNE), 655 K Street, NW, Suite 750, Washington, DC 20001, 202-887-6791. Goodwin University is a member of <a href="http://nc-sara.org/sara-states-institutions">SARA</a> and therefore can offer our RN-to-BSN program to residents of other SARA states.</p>

<p class="small">The RN-to-BSN program was granted initial accreditation by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) in February 2016. As of February 10, 2021, the accreditation was renewed for 10 years, extending to December 31, 2031. The ABSN program, which was offered for the first time in Fall 2019 per CCNE is included under this initial BSN accreditation. The next evaluation visit is scheduled for Spring of 2031.</p>

<p class="small">Secondary to the delay in ADN graduates being able to take the NCLEX related to COVID 19, graduates from the associate degree program at Goodwin University only, may be admitted to the RN-BSN track and take NUR 300 and NUR 310 without an RN license. This interim policy became effective for the April 2020 graduates and will remain in place until NCLEX testing centers resume their regular scheduling processes.</p>
